x runner
x assertion helpers
  - More helpful output on failed assertEqual calls
x pending
- multiple assertions per It? (note: difficult to do in a readable way)
- syntax munging (?)
- testing in monads, especially IO
  - before/after helpers (aka setup/teardown)
- dependent contexts:  only run enclosed tests if a given assertion passes (haven't added this because I haven't needed it in a Haskell project yet)
